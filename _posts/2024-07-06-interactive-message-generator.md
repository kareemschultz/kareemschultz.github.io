# Interactive Message Generator

Today, we're exploring a fun and interactive message generator that I've developed. This Python script creates personalized messages with a cool typing effect, making it perfect for romantic notes, friendly messages, or custom greetings!

## The Code

Here's the Python script for our message generator:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/kareemschultz/b8c43ed1df19b6dae887bda3cadf9c9f.js"></script>

You can copy this code and run it locally on your machine to generate personalized messages.

The script performs the following steps:

1. Takes the recipient's name as input.
2. Allows you to choose between pre-defined message templates (romantic or friendly) or a custom message.
3. Generates the message based on your choice.
4. Displays the message with a cool typing effect.

## Key Features

- Choice of romantic or friendly pre-defined messages
- Option to create a custom message

## Running the Script

To run this script:

1. Copy the code from the Gist above.
2. Paste it into a new file named `message_generator.py`.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing your `message_generator.py` file.
5. Run the script by typing `python message_generator.py`.
6. Follow the prompts to generate your personalized message!

Feel free to modify the script to add more message templates or customize the existing ones to suit your needs!
