- Network security and compliance
- Automation and scripting (Python, Ansible)

## Homelab Enthusiast

When I'm not managing enterprise networks, you'll find me tinkering in my homelab. It's my personal testbed for exploring new technologies, experimenting with cutting-edge tools, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in a home network environment.
